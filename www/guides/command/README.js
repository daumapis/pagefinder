In the future, the compiler\nwill optimize many of the high-level semantics provided by Sencha frameworks to reduce\nload time of your applications.</li>\n<li>Web Server: Provides a lightweight web server that serves files from localhost.</li>\n<li>Packaging: Native packaging to convert a Sencha Touch application into a first-class, mobile\napplication that has access to device functionality and can be distributed in App Stores.</li>\n<li>Management System: Distributed package management system for easy integration of packages (such as Ext JS\nThemes) created by others or from the Sencha Package Repository.</li>\n<li>Build Scripts: Generated build script for applications and packages with \"before\" and \"after\" extension\npoints so you can customize the build process to fit your specific needs.</li>\n<li>Tuning Tools: Powerful code selection tools for tuning what is included in your application's final\nbuild, determine common code across pages and partition shared code into \"packages\" - all\nusing high-level set operations to get builds exactly as you want them.</li>\n<li>Workspace Management: Assists in sharing frameworks, packages and custom code between\napplications.</li>\n<li>Image Capture: Converts CSS3 features (such as border-radius and linear-gradient)\ninto sprites for legacy browsers.</li>\n<li>Flexible Configuration System: Enables defaults to be specified for command options\nat the application or workspace level or across all workspaces on a machine.</li>\n<li>Logging: Robust logging to help you understand the inner workings of commands and facilitate\ntroubleshooting.</li>\n<li>Third-party Software: Sencha Cmd includes a compatible version of Compass, Sass, and\nApache Ant.</li>\n<li>Code Generation Hooks: Can be specific to one page or shared by all pages in the\nworkspace, for example, to check coding conventions or guidelines as new models are\ngenerated).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h2 id='command-section-compatibility'>Compatibility</h2>\n\n<p>Sencha Cmd is designed for Sencha Ext JS version 4.1.1a or higher and Sencha Touch\nversion 2.1 or higher. Many of the new features of Sencha Cmd require framework support\nthat is only available at these or later version levels. Some low-level commands\ncan be used for older versions of Sencha frameworks or JavaScript in general.</p>\n\n<p>If you are using an older version of Ext JS, you may use Sencha Cmd's <code>build</code> command to\nbuild via your JSB file. In other words, Sencha Cmd can replace JSBuilder to produce a\ncompressed build of the files described in a JSB file. Sencha Cmd will not update your JSB\nfile as was done by the previous SDK Tools v2.</p>\n\n<p>Sencha Touch 2.0 and Sencha Ext JS 4.0 require <a href=\"http://www.sencha.com/products/sdk-tools\">SDK Tools v2</a>;\nhowever SDK Tools are deprecated for use with releases after these.</p>\n\n<h2 id='command-section-system-setup'>System Setup</h2>\n\n<p>Follow these steps to set up your system and start using Sencha Cmd:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Download and install a\n<a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html\">Java Run-time Environment or JRE</a>.\nIt is best to download the most up-to-date version available. The JRE version must be at\nleast JRE 6, JRE 7 is best.</li>\n<li>Download and install <a href=\"http://www.sencha.com/products/sencha-cmd\">Sencha Cmd</a>.</li>\n<li>Download the appropriate version of the <a href=\"http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/\">Ext JS SDK</a> for\ndesktop applications or <a href=\"http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/\">Sencha Touch</a> for mobile applications.</li>\n<li>Extract the SDK to a local directory.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<h3 id='command-section-compass-and-sass-setup'>Compass and Sass Setup</h3>\n\n<p>Sencha Cmd includes compatible versions of <strong>Compass</strong> and <strong>Sass</strong> that you can use to\ndevelop CSS content using Sass. To get Compass and Sass working on your computer, you need\nto install  Ruby version 1.9.3 (Ruby version 2.0 is not supported):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Windows: Download Ruby 1.9.3 from <a href=\"http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads\">rubyinstaller.org</a>.\nDownload the RubyInstaller .exe file and run it.</p></li>\n<li><p>Mac OS: Ruby is pre-installed. You can test which version\nyou have with the <code>ruby -v</code> command. If you have version 2.0,\ndownload the <a href=\"https://rvm.io/\">Ruby version manager</a> (rvm) and use this command to\ndownload and install Ruby: <code>rvm install 1.9.3 --with-gcc=clang</code></p>\n\n<p>Set your PATH variable to point to the Ruby 1.9.3 install directory.</p></li>\n<li><p>Ubuntu: Use <code>sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.3</code> to download and install Ruby 1.9.3.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h3 id='command-section-verify-installation'>Verify Installation</h3>\n\n<p>To verify that Sencha Cmd is working properly, open a command line, change directory to\nyour application, and type the <code>sencha</code> command.</p>\n\n<p>You should see output that starts with:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Sencha Cmd v3.1.n\n...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If this message appears and the version number is 3.1.n or higher, you are all set.</p>\n\n<h2 id='command-section-upgrading-sencha-cmd'>Upgrading Sencha Cmd</h2>\n\n<p>The <code>sencha upgrade</code> feature lets you upgrade Sencha Cmd.</p>\n\n<p>Check for new updates to Sencha Cmd:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sencha upgrade --check\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Without the <code>--check</code> option, the <code>sencha upgrade</code> command downloads and installs the\nlatest version if you don't already have it:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sencha upgrade\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you want to check for beta releases, use:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sencha upgrade --check --beta\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To install the latest beta version:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sencha upgrade --beta\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>After the installer is done, start a new console or terminal\nto pick up the changes to your PATH environment variable.</p>\n\n<p>Because multiple versions of Sencha Cmd can be installed side-by-side, you can safely try\nthe Beta channel and then uninstall the beta (or adjust the PATH) to go back to the stable\nversion. Upgrading your applications using <code>sencha upgrade</code> however, is something you\nmay need \"roll back\" if you downgrade to an older Sencha Cmd.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong> It is possible that the most current release is in either the \"beta\" or stable\nchannel. That is to say, <code>sencha upgrade --beta</code> may install a beta that predates the\ncurrent release that would be installed by <code>sencha upgrade</code>.</p>\n\n<h2 id='command-section-command-basics'>Command Basics</h2>\n\n<p>Sencha Cmd features are arranged in categories (or modules) and commands:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sencha [category] [command] [options...] [arguments...]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Help is available using the <code>help</code> command.</p>\n\n<pre><code>sencha help [module] [action]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For example, try this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sencha help\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And you should see this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Sencha Cmd v3.1.n\n...\n\nOptions\n  * --cwd, -cw - Sets the directory from which commands should execute\n  * --debug, -d - Sets log level to higher verbosity\n  * --nologo, -n - Suppress the initial Sencha Cmd version display\n  * --plain, -pl - enables plain logging output (no highlighting)\n  * --quiet, -q - Sets log level to warnings and errors only\n  * --sdk-path, -s - The location of the SDK to use for non-app commands\n  * --time, -ti - Display the execution time after executing all commands\n\nCategories\n  * app - Perform various application build processes\n  * compass - Wraps execution of compass for sass compilation\n  * compile - Compile sources to produce concatenated output and metadata\n  * fs - Utility commands to work with files\n  * generate - Generates models, controllers, etc. or an entire application\n  * io - Create, deploy and manage applications on the Sencha.io cloud platform\n  * iofs - Manage Files stored in the Sencha.io cloud platform\n  * manifest - Extract class metadata\n  * package - Manages local and remote packages\n  * repository - Manage local repository and remote repository connections\n  * theme - Commands for low-level operations on themes\n\nCommands\n  * ant - Invoke Ant with helpful properties back to Sencha Cmd\n  * build - Builds a project from a legacy JSB3 file.\n  * config - Load a properties file or sets a configuration property\n  * help - Displays help for commands\n  * js - Executes arbitrary JavaScript file(s)\n  * upgrade - Upgrades Sencha Cmd\n  * which - Displays the path to the current version of Sencha Cmd\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2 id='command-section-current-directory'>Current Directory</h2>\n\n<p>In many cases, Sencha Cmd requires that you set a specific current directory. Or it may\njust need to know details about the relevant SDK. The appropriate SDK can be determined\nautomatically by Sencha Cmd when it is run from a generated application folder or, for\nsome few commands, from an extracted SDK folder.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Important</strong> For the following commands, Sencha Cmd needs to be run from the root folder\nof a generated application. The commands fail if not run from the application's root folder.</p>\n\n<pre><code>* `sencha generate ...` (for commands other than `app`, `package` and `workspace`)\n* `sencha app ...`\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>To generate an application, run the following command from an extracted SDK folder:</p>\n\n<pre><code>cd /path/to/SDK\nsencha generate app ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Or you can use the <code>-sdk</code> switch:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sencha -sdk /path/to/sdk generate app ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When using the compiler, Sencha Cmd detects the framework in use when run from an\napplication folder. If you are not running from a generated application, you may need to\nuse the <code>-sdk</code> switch:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sencha -sdk /path/to/sdk compile ...\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Important</strong> Do not specify the <code>-sdk</code> parameter for <code>sencha app</code> commands. As noted\nabove, these commands must be run from the application's root folder and therefore\nautomatically know which SDK to use. Using <code>-sdk</code> on these commands causes Sencha Cmd\nto believe your current directory is the SDK specified which is not the proper current\ndirectory for an application.</p>\n\n<h2 id='command-section-developing-applications'>Developing Applications</h2>\n\n<p>The starting point for most projects is to generate an application skeleton. This is done\nusing the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sencha -sdk /path/to/sdk generate app MyApp /path/to/MyApp\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Ext JS and Sencha Touch applications are structured differently from each other. Further,\nparticularly with Ext JS, applications can be quite large and may contain multiple pages.</p>\n\n<p>To get started building applications using Sencha Cmd, consult the\n<a href=\"#!/guide/command_app\">Using Sencha Cmd</a> guide.</p>\n\n<h3 id='command-section-sencha-cmd-web-server'>Sencha Cmd Web Server</h3>\n\n<p>The Sencha Cmd web server lets you serve files from your applications directory.\nUse this command to start the web server:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sencha fs web [-port 8000] start -map &lt;dir_name&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(You can use any available TCP port number or omit it and use the default.)</p>\n\n<p>To access the Sencha Cmd web server, use:</p>\n\n<pre><code>http://localhost:8000/\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2 id='command-section-beyond-the-basics'>Beyond The Basics</h2>\n\n<p>There are many other details related to using Sencha Cmd that can be helpful. The <code>help</code>\ncommand is a great reference, but if you want to walk through all the highlights, consult\n<a href=\"#!/guide/command_advanced\">Advanced Sencha Cmd</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id='command-section-troubleshooting'>Troubleshooting</h2>\n\n<p>Here are some tips for solving common problems encountered when using Sencha Cmd.</p>\n\n<h3 id='command-section-command-not-found'>Command Not Found</h3>\n\n<p>If running <code>sencha</code> results in the error message <code>sencha: command not found</code> on OSX/Linux\nor <code>'sencha' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or\nbatch file</code> on Windows, follow these steps:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Close all existing terminal/command prompt windows and reopen them.</li>\n<li>Make sure that Sencha Cmd is properly installed:\n\n<ul>\n<li>The installation directory exists. By default, the installation path is:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Windows: <code>C:\\Users\\Me\\bin\\Sencha\\Cmd\\{version}</code></li>\n<li>Mac OS X: <code>~/bin/Sencha/Cmd/{version}</code></li>\n<li>Linux: <code>~/bin/Sencha/Cmd/{version}</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The path to Sencha Cmd directory is prepended to your PATH environment variable.\nFrom the terminal, run <code>echo %PATH%</code> on Windows or <code>echo $PATH</code> on Mac or Linux.\nThe Sencha Cmd directory should be displayed in part of the output. If this is not\nthe case, add it to your PATH manually.</li>\n<li>The environment variable <code>SENCHA_CMD_{version}</code> is set, with the value being\nthe absolute path to the installation directory mentioned above. For example, if the\ninstalled version is 3.1.2, a <code>SENCHA_CMD_3_1_2</code> must be set. If the output is\nempty, set the environment variable manually. To check, go to the command prompt (or\nTerminal) and run:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Windows: <code>echo %SENCHA_CMD_3_1_2%</code></li>\n<li>Other - <code>echo $SENCHA_CMD_3_1_2</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h3 id='command-section-cannot-find-ruby'>Cannot find Ruby</h3>\n\n<p>If you see an error related to not recognizing or finding <code>\"ruby\"</code> this is likely because\nRuby is not installed or is not in your PATH. See the previous System Requirements section.</p>\n\n<h3 id='command-section-wrong-current-directory'>Wrong Current Directory</h3>\n\n<p>A common mistake is to perform a command that requires the current directory to be either\nan extracted SDK directory or an application directory, but such a directory has not been\nset. If this requirement is not met, Sencha Cmd displays an error and exits.</p>\n\n<p>Note that a valid application directory is one that was generated by Sencha Cmd.</p>\n\n<h3 id='command-section-errors-while-resolving-dependencies'>Errors While Resolving Dependencies</h3>\n\n<p>The <code>sencha app build</code> command works by reading your <code>index.html</code> and scanning for\nrequired classes. If your application does not properly declare the classes it requires,\nthe build usually completes but will not contain all the classes needed by your application.</p>\n\n<p>To ensure that you have all required classes specified, always develop with the debugger\nconsole enabled (\"Developer Tools\" in IE/Chrome, FireBug in FireFox and Web Inspector in\nSafari) and resolve all warnings and error messages as they appear.</p>\n\n<p>Whenever you see a warning like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[<a href=\"#!/api/Ext.Loader\" rel=\"Ext.Loader\" class=\"docClass\">Ext.Loader</a>] Synchronously loading 'Ext.foo.Bar'; consider adding 'Ext.foo.Bar' explicitly as a require of the corresponding class\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Immediately add 'Ext.foo.Bar' inside the <code>requires</code> array property of the class from\nwhich the dependency originates. If it is a application-wide dependency, add it to the\n<code>requires</code> array property inside <code><a href=\"#!/api/Ext-method-application\" rel=\"Ext-method-application\" class=\"docClass\">Ext.application</a>(...)</code> statement.</p>\n","title":"Introduction to Sencha Cmd"});
